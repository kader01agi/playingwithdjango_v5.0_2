        SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name;
        SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name;
        SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT column) FROM table_name;
        SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE Country='Mexico';
        SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE condition;
        SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE CustomerID=1;
        
        <>	Not equal. Note: In some versions of SQL this operator may be written as !=
        BETWEEN	Between a certain range	
        LIKE	Search for a pattern	
        IN	To specify multiple possible values for a column


        Use the NOT keyword to select all records where City is NOT "Berlin".
            SELECT * FROM table_name <strong>WHERE NOT</strong> City='Berlin';
            
            
        Select all records where the City column has the value 'Berlin' and the PostalCode column has the value 12209.
            SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE City='Berlin' AND PostalCode=12209;
        
        Select all records where the City column has the value 'Berlin' or 'London'.
            SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE City='Berlin' OR City='London';
        
        SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY Price; # ascending order by default
        SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY Price DESC;
        SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name;
        SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;
        SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column1, column2;
        SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name ASC, column_name DESC;

        For string values the ORDER BY keyword will order "alphabetically":
        (SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name;)
        (SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name DESC;)

        SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;
            SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Country = 'Spain' AND CustomerName <strong><mark>LIKE</mark></strong> 'G%';
            SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Country = 'Germany' AND City = 'Berlin' AND PostalCode > 12000;
        
        Select all Spanish customers that starts with <mark>either "G" or "R":
            SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Country = 'Spain' AND (CustomerName LIKE 'G%' OR CustomerName LIKE 'R%');</mark>
        Without parenthesis, the select statement will return all customers from Spain that starts with a "G", 
        plus all customers that starts with an "R", regardless of the country value.

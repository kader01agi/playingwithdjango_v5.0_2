    <pre>
        SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name;
        SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name;
        SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT column) FROM table_name;
        SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE Country='Mexico';
        SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE condition;
        SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE CustomerID=1;
        
        <>	Not equal. Note: In some versions of SQL this operator may be written as !=
        BETWEEN	Between a certain range	
        LIKE	Search for a pattern	
        IN	To specify multiple possible values for a column


        Use the NOT keyword to select all records where City is NOT "Berlin".
            SELECT * FROM table_name <strong>WHERE NOT</strong> City='Berlin';
            
            
        Select all records where the City column has the value 'Berlin' and the PostalCode column has the value 12209.
            SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE City='Berlin' AND PostalCode=12209;
        
        Select all records where the City column has the value 'Berlin' or 'London'.
            SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE City='Berlin' OR City='London';
        
        SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY Price; # ascending order by default
        SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY Price DESC;
        SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name;
        SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;
        SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column1, column2;
        SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name ASC, column_name DESC;

        For string values the ORDER BY keyword will order "alphabetically":
        (SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name;)
        (SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name DESC;)

        SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;
            SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Country = 'Spain' AND CustomerName <strong><mark>LIKE</mark></strong> 'G%';
            SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Country = 'Germany' AND City = 'Berlin' AND PostalCode > 12000;
        
        Select all Spanish customers that starts with <mark>either "G" or "R":
            SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Country = 'Spain' AND (CustomerName LIKE 'G%' OR CustomerName LIKE 'R%');</mark>
        Without parenthesis, the select statement will return all customers from Spain that starts with a "G", 
        plus all customers that starts with an "R", regardless of the country value.
    
    SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE NOT condition;
    SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE CustomerName NOT LIKE 'A%';
    
    SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE CustomerID NOT BETWEEN 10 AND 60;
    SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City NOT IN ('Paris', 'London');

    Select customers with a CustomerId not greater than 50:
    SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE NOT CustomerID > 50;
    <b>Note</b>: There is a not-greater-then operator: <b>!></b> that would give you the same result.

    Select customers with a CustomerID not less than 50:
    SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE NOT CustomerId < 50;
    <b>Note</b>: There is a not-less-than operator: <b>!<</b> that would give you the same result.

    SELECT column_names FROM table_name WHERE column_name IS NULL;
    SELECT column_names FROM table_name WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;

    UPDATE table_name
    SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
    WHERE condition;

    UPDATE Customers
    SET ContactName = 'Alfred Schmidt', City= 'Frankfurt'
    WHERE CustomerID = 1;

    DELETE Syntax
    <mark>DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;</mark> 

    Delete All Records
    It is possible to delete all rows in a table without deleting the table. This means that the table structure, 
    attributes, and indexes will be intact:
        <em>DELETE FROM table_name;</em>

    Delete a Table
        DROP TABLE table_name;
    
    
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_top.asp"><mark>SQL TOP, LIMIT, FETCH FIRST or ROWNUM Clause</mark></a>

        MySQL Syntax:

        SELECT column_name(s)
        FROM table_name
        WHERE condition
        LIMIT number;

        SELECT * FROM table_name
        LIMIT 3;

        SELECT TOP 50 PERCENT * FROM table_name;

        SELECT * FROM table_name
        WHERE Country='Germany'
        LIMIT 3;

        SELECT * FROM table_name
        ORDER BY CustomerName DESC
        LIMIT 3;



        Oracle 12 Syntax:

        SELECT column_name(s)
        FROM table_name
        ORDER BY column_name(s)
        FETCH FIRST n ROWS ONLY;

        SELECT * FROM table_name
        FETCH FIRST 3 ROWS ONLY;

        SELECT * FROM table_name
        FETCH FIRST 50 PERCENT ROWS ONLY;

        SELECT * FROM table_name
        WHERE column_name='Germany'
        FETCH FIRST 3 ROWS ONLY;

        SELECT * FROM table_name
        ORDER BY column_name DESC
        FETCH FIRST 3 ROWS ONLY;
    </pre>

    <h2>The SQL MIN() and MAX() Functions</h2>
    <pre>
    SELECT MIN(column_name)
    FROM table_name;

    SELECT MAX(column_name)
    FROM table_name;

    SELECT MIN(column_name)
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition;
    </pre>
    <h3>Set Column Name (Alias)</h3>

    <pre>When you use MIN() or MAX(), the returned column will be named MIN(field) or MAX(field) by default. To give the
    column a new name, use the AS keyword:

    SELECT MIN(Price) AS SmallestPrice
    FROM table_name;
    </pre>

    <h2>The SQL COUNT() Function</h2>
    <pre>The COUNT() function returns the <b>number of rows</b> that matches a specified criterion.
    Find the total number of products in the Products table:

    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Products;
    If you specify a column instead of (*), NULL values will not be counted.
    SELECT COUNT(ProductName)
    FROM Products;

    If DISTINCT is specified, rows with the same value for the specified column will be counted as one.
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Price)
    FROM Products;

    SELECT COUNT(column_name)
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition;
    </pre>

    <h2>SQL SUM() Function</h2>
    <p>SELECT SUM(column_name) FROM table_name;</p>

    <p>SELECT SUM(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;</p>

    <pre>Give the summarized column a name by using the AS keyword.</pre>
    <p>SELECT SUM(column_name) AS <i>Alias</i> FROM table_name;</p>

    <h2>SQL AVG() Function</h2>

    <p>SELECT AVG(column_name) FROM table_name;</p>
    <p>SELECT AVG(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;</p>


    <h2>Higher Than Average</h2>
    <p>To list all records with a higher price than average, we can use the AVG() function in a sub query.</p>
    <pre>Example
    Return all products with a higher price than the average price:

    SELECT * FROM table_name
    WHERE price > (SELECT AVG(price) FROM table_name);</pre>
    <br>
    <h2>The SQL LIKE Operator</h2>
    <p>The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a <b>specified pattern</b> in a column.</p>
    <p>There are two wildcards often used in conjunction with the LIKE operator:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The percent sign % represents zero, one, or multiple characters</li>
        <li>The underscore sign _ represents one, single character</li>
    </ul>
    <pre>
        SELECT column1, column2, ...
        FROM table_name
        WHERE columnN LIKE pattern;

        SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name LIKE 'L_nd__';
    </pre>

    <p>Return all customers from a city that contains the letter 'L':</p>
    <p>SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name LIKE '%L%';</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Starts With</h2>
    <p>To return records that starts with a specific letter or phrase, add the % at the end of the letter or phrase.
        Return all customers that starts with 'La':</p>
    <p>SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name LIKE 'La%';</p>
    <br>
    <p>You can also combine any number of conditions using AND or OR operators.Return all customers that starts with 'a'
        or starts with 'b':</p>
    <p>SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE column_name LIKE 'a%' OR column_name LIKE 'b%';</p>


    <h2>Ends With</h2>
    <p>To return records that ends with a specific letter or phrase, add the % at the beginning of the letter or phrase.
        Return all customers that ends with 'a':</p>
    <p>SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name LIKE '%a';</p>
    <br>
    <p>You can also combine "starts with" and "ends with". Return all customers that starts with "b" and ends with "s":
    </p>
    <p>SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name LIKE 'b%s';</p>


    <h2>Contains</h2>
    <p></p>To return records that contains a specific letter or phrase, add the % both before and after the letter or
    phrase. Return all customers that contains the phrase 'or'
    <p>SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name LIKE '%or%';</p>
    <br>
    <pre>Return all customers that <u>starts with</u> "a" and are <u>at least 3 characters</u> in length:

    SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name LIKE 'a__%';</pre>

    <br>
    <p>Return all customers that have "r" in the second position:</p>
    <p>SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name LIKE '_r%';</p>

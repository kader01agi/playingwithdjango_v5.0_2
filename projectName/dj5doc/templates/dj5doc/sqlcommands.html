        SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name;
        SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name;
        SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT column) FROM table_name;
        SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE Country='Mexico';
        SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE condition;
        SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE CustomerID=1;
        
        <>	Not equal. Note: In some versions of SQL this operator may be written as !=
        BETWEEN	Between a certain range	
        LIKE	Search for a pattern	
        IN	To specify multiple possible values for a column


        Use the NOT keyword to select all records where City is NOT "Berlin".
            SELECT * FROM table_name <strong>WHERE NOT</strong> City='Berlin';
            
            
        Select all records where the City column has the value 'Berlin' and the PostalCode column has the value 12209.
            SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE City='Berlin' AND PostalCode=12209;
        
        Select all records where the City column has the value 'Berlin' or 'London'.
            SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE City='Berlin' OR City='London';
        
        SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY Price; # ascending order by default
        SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY Price DESC;
        SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name;
        SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;
        SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column1, column2;
        SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name ASC, column_name DESC;

        For string values the ORDER BY keyword will order "alphabetically":
        (SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name;)
        (SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name DESC;)

        SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;
            SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Country = 'Spain' AND CustomerName <strong><mark>LIKE</mark></strong> 'G%';
            SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Country = 'Germany' AND City = 'Berlin' AND PostalCode > 12000;
        
        Select all Spanish customers that starts with <mark>either "G" or "R":
            SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Country = 'Spain' AND (CustomerName LIKE 'G%' OR CustomerName LIKE 'R%');</mark>
        Without parenthesis, the select statement will return all customers from Spain that starts with a "G", 
        plus all customers that starts with an "R", regardless of the country value.
    
    SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE NOT condition;
    SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE CustomerName NOT LIKE 'A%';
    
    SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE CustomerID NOT BETWEEN 10 AND 60;
    SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City NOT IN ('Paris', 'London');

    Select customers with a CustomerId not greater than 50:
    SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE NOT CustomerID > 50;
    <b>Note</b>: There is a not-greater-then operator: <b>!></b> that would give you the same result.

    Select customers with a CustomerID not less than 50:
    SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE NOT CustomerId < 50;
    <b>Note</b>: There is a not-less-than operator: <b>!<</b> that would give you the same result.

    SELECT column_names FROM table_name WHERE column_name IS NULL;
    SELECT column_names FROM table_name WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;

    UPDATE table_name
    SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
    WHERE condition;

    UPDATE Customers
    SET ContactName = 'Alfred Schmidt', City= 'Frankfurt'
    WHERE CustomerID = 1;


    <mark>DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;</mark> 

    Delete All Records
    It is possible to delete all rows in a table without deleting the table. This means that the table structure, attributes, and indexes will be intact:
        <strong>DELETE FROM table_name;</strong>

    Delete a Table
        DROP TABLE table_name;

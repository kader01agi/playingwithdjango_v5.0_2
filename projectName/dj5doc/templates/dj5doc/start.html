<h2>Projects vs. apps</h2>
<p>What's the difference between a project and an app? An app is a web application that does something - e.g., a blog
    system, a database of public records or a small poll app. A project is a collection of configuration and apps for a
    particular website. A project can contain multiple apps. An app can be in multiple projects.</p>

<h2><strong><kbd>include()</kbd></strong></h2>
<p>The <strong><kbd>include()</kbd></strong> function allows referencing other URLconfs. Whenever Django encounters
    <strong><kbd>include()</kbd></strong>, it chops off whatever part of the URL matched up to that point and sends the
    remaining string to the included URLconf for further processing.
</p>

<p>The idea behind <strong><kbd>include()</kbd></strong> is to make it easy to plug-and-play URLs. Since polls are in
    their own URLconf (<strong>polls/urls.py</strong>), they can be placed under “/polls/”, or under “/fun_polls/”, or
    under “/content/polls/”, or any other path root, and the app will still work.</p>
<br>
<h2><strong><kbd>path()</kbd></strong></h2>
<p>The <strong>path()</strong> function is passed <strong><u>four arguments</u></strong>, two required:
    <strong>route</strong> and <strong>view</strong>, and two optional: <u>kwargs</u>, and <u>name</u>. At this point,
    it's worth reviewing what these arguments are for.

    <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/intro/tutorial01/#path-argument-route"
        target="_blank"><strong><kbd>path()</kbd></strong>
        argument: <strong>route</strong></a>
</p>
<p><strong>route</strong> is a <strong>string</strong> that contains a URL pattern. When processing a request, Django
    starts at the first pattern in urlpatterns and makes its way down the list, comparing the requested URL against each
    pattern until it finds one that matches.

    Patterns don't search GET and POST parameters, or the domain name. For example, in a request to
    <strong>https://www.example.com/myapp/</strong>, the URLconf will look for <strong>myapp/</strong>. In a request to
    <strong>https://www.example.com/myapp/?page=3</strong> , the URLconf will also look for <strong>myapp/</strong>.
</p>

    <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/intro/tutorial01/#path-argument-view"
        target="_blank"><strong><kbd>path()</kbd></strong>
        argument: <strong>view</strong></a>
</p>
<p>When Django finds a matching pattern, it calls the specified view function with an <a
        href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/ref/request-response/#django.http.HttpRequest"
        target="_blank">HttpRequest</a> object as the first argument and any “captured” values from the route as keyword
    arguments.</p>

<p>
    <strong><kbd>path()</kbd></strong>
    argument: <strong>kwargs</strong>
</p>
<p>Arbitrary keyword arguments can be passed in a <strong>dictionary</strong> to the target view.</p>
<p>
    <strong><kbd>path()</kbd></strong>
    argument: <strong>name</strong>
</p>
<p>Naming your URL lets you refer to it unambiguously from elsewhere in Django, especially from within templates. This
    <b>powerful feature</b> allows you to make global changes to the URL patterns of your project while only touching a
    single file.
